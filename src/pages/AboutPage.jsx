                <p className="text-lg">Hi, I'm Navisa Khairani, a fashion design student from Indonesia, currently studying at Billy Blue College of Design, Torrens University in Melbourne, Australia.</p>
                <p className="text-lg">I love turning ideas into clothing that tells a story. My style blends creativity with strong technical skills like patternmaking, sewing, draping, and hand beading. I enjoy exploring textures, silhouettes, and prints to bring each design to life.</p>
                <p className="text-lg">Throughout my studies, I've worked on many projects, from developing tech packs and spec sheets, to planning and directing photoshoots. I've also gained experience working as a dresser at Melbourne Fashion Festival, where I supported the behind the scenes.</p>
                <p className="text-lg">Fashion, to me, is more than just design. It's about expression, culture, and emotion. My goal is to create work that feels personal, meaningful, and beautifully made.</p>
